    Coreference resolution is the task of finding all expressions that refer to the same entity
    in a text. It is an important step for many higher level NLP tasks that involve natural
    language understanding such as document summarization, question answering, and information extraction.

    is a neural model which considers all possible spans in the document as potential mentions and
    learns distributions over possible anteceedents for each span, using aggressive
