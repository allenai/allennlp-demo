    Coreference resolution is the task of finding all expressions that refer to the same entity
    in a text. It is an important step for a lot of higher level NLP tasks that involve natural
    language understanding such as document summarization, question answering, and information extraction.

    is a neural model which considers all possible spans in the document as potential mentions and
    learns distributions over possible anteceedents for each span, using aggressive, learnt
    pruning strategies to retain computational efficiency. It achieved state-of-the-art accuracies on
