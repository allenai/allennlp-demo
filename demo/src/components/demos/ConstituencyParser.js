      A constituency parse tree breaks a text into sub-phrases, or constituents. Non-terminals in the tree are types of phrases, the terminals are the words in the sentence.
      This demo is an implementation of a minimal neural model for constituency parsing based on an independent scoring of labels and spans described in

      . This model uses <ExternalLink href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365">ELMo embeddings</ExternalLink>, which are completely character based and improves single model performance from 92.6 F1 to 94.11 F1 on the Penn Treebank, a 20% relative error reduction.
