This contrasts with expendable launch systems, where each launch vehicle is launched once and then discarded. No completely reusable orbital launch system has ever been created. Two partially reusable launch systems were developed, the Space Shuttle and Falcon 9. The Space Shuttle was partially reusable: the orbiter (which included the Space Shuttle main engines and the Orbital Maneuvering System engines), and the two solid rocket boosters were reused after several months of refitting work for each launch.

These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans. Robots can be used in any situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and de-activation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive. Robots can take on any form but some are made to resemble humans in appearance. This is said to help in the acceptance of a robot in certain replicative behaviors usually performed by people. Such robots attempt to replicate walking, lifting, speech, cognition, and basically anything a human can do.",
