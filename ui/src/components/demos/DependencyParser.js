    <p>
      Dependency parsing is the task of analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence and establishing the relationships between "head" words and the words which modify those heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      This demo is an implementation of a neural model for dependency parsing using biaffine classifiers on top of a bidirectional LSTM based
      on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{' '} Deep Biaffine Attention for Neural Dependency Parsing (Dozat, 2017).</a><br />
      The parser is trained on the PTB 3.0 dataset using Stanford dependencies, achieving 95.57% and 94.44% unlabeled and labeled attachement score using gold POS tags. For predicted POS tags, the model achieves 94.81% UAS and 92.86% LAS respectively.
